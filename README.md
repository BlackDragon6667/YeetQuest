# LeetQuest

A Web MMORPG forked off
[BrowserQuest](https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest).

## Usage

**Building the client**: To build the client, run `npm run build`.

**Building game maps**: This (particularly expensive) step needs to run
separately via `npm run build-maps`. It is only necessary when the
`tools/maps/tmx/map.tmx` file has been edited â€” the built map files are
version-controlled.

**Running the server**: To run the game server, run `npm start` (remember to
build the client if necessary). The server takes a single optional
command-line parameter, viz. the name of a configuration file, which defaults
to `config.json`. The configuration file overrides the defaults supplied in
`config.default.json`.

Additional documentation is located in the `client` and `server` directories.
