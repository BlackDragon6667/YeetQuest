# LeetQuest client

The client source code is located inside this directory, along with a built
version of the game map. The client is (fixedly) configured to derive the game
server URL from the page location, which should work in most instances.

The dependencies of the client (as well as of the server) are listed in the
project-level `package.json` file.
